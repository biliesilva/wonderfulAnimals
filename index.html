                <h2>Fox</h2>
                <p>Foxes are small to medium-sized, omnivorous mammals belonging to several genera of the family Canidae.
                    Foxes have
                    a flattened skull, upright triangular
                    ears, a pointed, slightly upturned snout, and a long bushy tail (or brush).</p>
                <p>Twelve species belong to the monophyletic "true foxes" group of genus Vulpes. Approximately another 25
                    current or
                    extinct species are always or sometimes
                    called foxes; these foxes are either part of the paraphyletic group of the South American foxes, or of
                    the
                    outlying group, which consists of the bat-eared
                    fox, gray fox, and island fox.[1] Foxes live on every continent except Antarctica. By far the most
                    common and
                    widespread species of fox is the red fox
                    (Vulpes vulpes) with about 47 recognized subspecies.[2] The global distribution of foxes, together with
                    their
                    widespread reputation for cunning,
                    has contributed to their prominence in popular culture and folklore in many societies around the world.
                    The
                    hunting of foxes with packs of hounds,
                    long an established pursuit in Europe, especially in the British Isles, was exported by European
                    settlers to
                    various parts of the New World.</p>

                <h2>Squirrel</h2>
                <p>Squirrels are members of the family Sciuridae, a family that includes small or medium-size rodents. The
                    squirrel
                    family includes tree squirrels, ground
                    squirrels, chipmunks, marmots (including groundhogs), flying squirrels, and prairie dogs amongst other
                    rodents.
                    Squirrels are indigenous to the Americas,
                    Eurasia, and Africa, and were introduced by humans to Australia.[1] The earliest known fossilized
                    squirrels date
                    from the Eocene epoch, and among other
                    living rodent families, the squirrels are most closely related to the mountain beaver and to the
                    dormice.</p>
                <p>The word "squirrel", first attested in 1327, comes from the Anglo-Norman esquirel which is from the Old
                    French
                    escurel, the reflex of a Latin word
                    sciurus. This Latin word was borrowed from the Ancient Greek word σκίουρος, skiouros, which means
                    shadow-tailed,
                    referring to the bushy appendage
                    possessed by many of its members.[2][3]</p>
    
                <p>The native Old English word for the squirrel, ācweorna, survived only into Middle English (as aquerne)
                    before
                    being replaced.[4] The Old English word is
                    of Common Germanic origin, cognates of which are still used in other Germanic languages, including the
                    German
                    Eichhörnchen (diminutive of Eichhorn, which
                    is not as frequently used), the Norwegian ikorn/ekorn, the Dutch eekhoorn, the Swedish ekorre and the
                    Danish
                    egern.</p>

                <h2>Bear</h2>
                <p>Bears are carnivoran mammals of the family Ursidae. They are classified as caniforms, or doglike
                    carnivorans.
                    There are eight species in existence: Asiatic
                    black bears (also called moon bears), brown bears (which include grizzly bears), giant pandas, North
                    American
                    black bears, polar bears, sloth bears,
                    spectacled bears (also called Andean bears), and sun bears[1]. Although only eight species of bears are
                    extant,
                    they are widespread, appearing in a wide
                    variety of habitats throughout the Northern Hemisphere and partially in the Southern Hemisphere. Bears
                    are found
                    on the continents of North America,
                    South America, Europe, and Asia. Common characteristics of modern bears include large bodies with stocky
                    legs,
                    long snouts, small rounded ears, shaggy
                    hair, plantigrade paws with five nonretractile claws, and short tails.</p>
                <p>While the polar bear is mostly carnivorous, and the giant panda feeds almost entirely on bamboo, the
                    remaining
                    six species are omnivorous with varied
                    diets. With the exception of courting individuals and mothers with their young, bears are typically
                    solitary
                    animals. They may be diurnal or nocturnal
                    and have an excellent sense of smell. Despite their heavy build and awkward gait, they are adept
                    runners,
                    climbers, and swimmers. Bears use shelters,
                    such as caves and logs, as their dens; most species occupy their dens during the winter for a long
                    period of
                    hibernation, up to 100 days.</p>

                <h2>Wolf</h2>
                <p>The wolf (Canis lupus[a]), also known as the gray wolf or grey wolf, is a large canine native to Eurasia
                    and
                    North America. More than thirty subspecies
                    of Canis lupus have been recognized, and gray wolves, as colloquially understood, comprise
                    non-domestic/feral
                    subspecies. The wolf is the largest extant
                    member of Canidae, males averaging 40 kg (88 lb) and females 37 kg (82 lb). Wolves measure 105–160 cm
                    (41–63 in)
                    in length and 80–85 cm (31–33 in) at
                    shoulder height. The wolf is also distinguished from other Canis species by its less pointed ears and
                    muzzle, as
                    well as a shorter torso and a longer
                    tail. The wolf is nonetheless related closely enough to smaller Canis species, such as the coyote and
                    the golden
                    jackal, to produce fertile hybrids with
                    them. The banded fur of a wolf is usually mottled white, brown, gray, and black, although subspecies in
                    the
                    arctic region may be nearly all white.</p>
                <p>Of all members of the genus Canis, the wolf is most specialized for cooperative game hunting as
                    demonstrated by
                    its physical adaptations to tackling
                    large prey, its more social nature, and its highly advanced expressive behaviour. It travels in nuclear
                    families
                    consisting of a mated pair accompanied
                    by their offspring. Offspring may leave to form their own packs on the onset of sexual maturity and in
                    response
                    to competition for food within the pack.
                    Wolves are also territorial and fights over territory are among the principal causes of wolf mortality.
                    The wolf
                    is mainly a carnivore and feeds on
                    large wild hooved mammals as well as smaller animals, livestock, carrion, and garbage. Single wolves or
                    mated
                    pairs typically have higher success
                    rates in hunting than do large packs. Pathogens and parasites, notably rabies, may infect wolves.</p>

                <h2>Mandrill</h2>
                <p>The mandrill (Mandrillus sphinx) is a primate of the Old World monkey (Cercopithecidae) family. It is one
                    of two
                    species assigned to the genus Mandrillus,
                    along with the drill. Both the mandrill and the drill were once classified as baboons in the genus
                    Papio, but
                    they now have their own genus, Mandrillus.
                    Although they look superficially like baboons, they are more closely related to Cercocebus mangabeys.
                    Mandrills
                    are found in southern Cameroon, Gabon,
                    Equatorial Guinea, and Congo. Mandrills mostly live in tropical rainforest and in very large groups.
                    Mandrills
                    have an omnivorous diet consisting mostly
                    of fruits and insects. Their mating season peaks in July to September, with a corresponding birth peak
                    in
                    December to April.</p>
                <p>The mandrill has an olive green or dark grey pelage with yellow and black bands and a white belly. Its
                    hairless
                    face has an elongated muzzle with
                    distinctive characteristics, such as a red stripe down the middle and protruding blue ridges on the
                    sides. It
                    also has red nostrils and lips,
                    a yellow beard and white tufts. The areas around the genitals and the anus are multi-colored, being red,
                    pink,
                    blue, scarlet, and purple. They also have
                    pale pink ischial callosities. The coloration of the animal is more pronounced in dominant adult males.
                    Both
                    sexes have chest glands, which are used
                    in olfactory communication. These, too, are more prominent in dominant adult males.[6] Males also have
                    longer
                    canines than females, which can be up to 6.35 cm (2.50 in) and 1.0 cm, respectively.[7]</p>

                <h2>Fox</h2>
                <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a species in the family Felidae and a member of the genus Panthera. It is most
                    recognisable for its muscular, deep-chested body,
                    short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic;
                    adult male
                    lions have a prominent mane. With a typical
                    head-to-body length of 184–208 cm (72–82 in) they are larger than females at 160–184 cm (63–72 in). It
                    is a
                    social species, forming groups called prides.
                    A lion pride consists of a few adult males, related females and cubs. Groups of female lions usually
                    hunt
                    together, preying mostly on large ungulates.
                    The lion is an apex and keystone predator, although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur, and
                    have been
                    known to hunt humans, although the species
                    typically does not.</p>
                <p>Typically, the lion inhabits grasslands and savannas, but is absent in dense forests. It is usually more
                    diurnal
                    than other big cats, but when persecuted
                    it adapts to being active at night and at twilight. In the Pleistocene, the lion ranged throughout
                    Eurasia,
                    Africa and North America, but today it has
                    been reduced to fragmented populations in sub-Saharan Africa and one critically endangered population in
                    western
                    India. It has been listed as Vulnerable
                    on the IUCN Red List since 1996 because populations in African countries have declined by about 43%
                    since the
                    early 1990s. Lion populations are untenable
                    outside designated protected areas. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat
                    loss and
                    conflicts with humans are the greatest
                    causes for concern.</p>
